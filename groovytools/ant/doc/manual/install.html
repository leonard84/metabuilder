<h1>Installing Gpp</h1>
<h2><a name="getting">Getting Gpp</a></h2>
<p>
The Gpp source is available from the SourceForge project web site as both 
a .zip or as a .tar.gz.  Get the latest release from 
<a target="_top" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=208227">here</a>.</p>
<p>
See the section <a href="#buildinggpp">Building Gpp</a> on how to
build Gpp from the source code.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="sysrequirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
Gpp should run virtually anywhere that Ant runs, including 
including Linux, Cygwin, commercial flavors of Unix such as Solaris, AIX, 
HP-UX, Windows 9x and NT, Novell Netware 6 and MacOS X.
<p>
To build and use Gpp, you must have an Ant 1.6.x release
installed and <code>ANT_HOME</code> defined.  The necessary Groovy libraries 
are included with Gpp.</p>
<p>
Finally, to execute Gpp, you will also need a JDK installed on 
your system, version 1.4.2 or later. 
</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="installing">Installing Gpp</a></h2>
<p>Before Ant 1.6, extensions were installed by copying .jars into
<code>$ANT_HOME/lib</code>.  Since Ant 1.6, there is a new way to extend Ant
using the <b>Antlib</b> convention.  Gpp may either be installed as an
extension or as an Antlib.</p>

<p><em>Note: How you will use Gpp in your projects depends on whether
you install Gpp as an extension or as an Antlib.</em></p>

<h3>Install Gpp as an Extension (the 'Old Way')</h3>
This method is supported by both Ant 1.5 and 1.6 releases, so is currently
the safest to use.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Ant and define <code>ANT_HOME</code>, if you haven't already</li>
<li>Download and uncompress the Gpp release on your local system.</li>
<li>Change directory to your Gpp installation directory and execute
<pre>
	<b>ant deploy</b>
</pre>
<li>You are now ready to use Gpp in your build files as an extension, so
see the section on Using Gpp to see what to do next.
</ol>

<h3>Install Gpp as an Antlib (the 'New Way')</h3>
This method is only supported by 1.6 releases.
<ol>
<li>Install Ant and define <code>ANT_HOME</code>, if you haven't already.</li>
<li>Download and uncompress the Gpp release on your local system.</li>
<li>Add <code><b>$GPP_HOME/groovytools-ant-x.0.0.jar</b></code> to
your <code><b>CLASSPATH</b></code>.
<li>You are now ready to use Gpp in your build files as an Antlib, so go to
the section on Using Gpp to see what to do next.
</ol>

<h3>What Gets Installed</h3>
<p>The Gpp distribution consists of the following directory layout:
<pre>
   $Gpp_HOME          // installation directory
   |
   +--- doc           // contains documentation
   |    |
   |    +--- api      // contains Gpp Javadoc API
   |    |
   |    +--- howto    // contains various Gpp howto guides
   |    |
   |    +--- manual   // contains this manual
   |
   +--- example       // contains a simple project demonstrating Gpp
   |
   +--- lib           // contains Gpp and dependent jars
   |
   +--- src           // contains Gpp sources
</pre>
