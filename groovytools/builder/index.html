<h1>MetaBuilder</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
    <b>MetaBuilder</b> extends Groovy's <tt>ObjectGraphBuilder</tt> to include a metadata builder, which then may be
    used to control the object graph that is built.
</p>
<h4>A Quick Example</h4>
<p>
    To give you a quick idea of what can be done with <b>MetaBuilder</b> take a look at the following Groovy
    script and see if you can find the typo:
</p>
  <pre>
        def nb = new NodeBuilder()

        def anInvoice = nb.invoice(date: new Date()) {
            items {
                item(upc: 123, qty: 1, price: 14.99)
                item(upe: 234, qty: 4, price: 14.99)
                item(upc: 345, qty: 6, price: 14.99)
            }
        }</pre>
<p>
    The typo in the second item would normally go undetected until possibly much later when something tries to process
    these nodes. <b>MetaBuilder</b> can catch this kind of error and do much more.  But first you have to define a schema:
</p>
<pre>
        import groovytools.builder.*

        def mb = new MetaBuilder()
        def invoiceSchema =  mb.define {
            invoice {
                <strong><em>properties</em></strong> {
                    date()
                }
                <strong><em>collections</em></strong> {
                    items {
                        item {
                            <strong><em>properties</em></strong> {
                                upc()
                                price()
                                qty()
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } </pre>
<p>
    <b>MetaBuilder</b> schema is easy to understand.  Properties of an object are defined within a node called
    <tt>properties</tt>.  Collections and maps are defined within a node called <tt>collections</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    Ok, now that you have a schema, you use it almost exactly as before.  I've highlighted the differences:
</p>
<pre>
        def anInvoice = <strong><em>mb.build</em></strong> {
            invoice(date: new Date()) {
                items {
                    item(upc: 123, qty: 1, price: 14.99)
                    item(upe: 234, qty: 4, price: 14.99)
                    item(upc: 345, qty: 6, price: 14.99)
                }
            }
        } </pre>
<p>
    Of course, I left the typo in there so that we could see what <b>MetaBuilder</b> reports:
</p>
<pre>
    <strong><tt>groovytools.builder.PropertyException: Property 'upe': property unkown</tt></strong> </pre>
<p>
    Now you get immediate feedback when there are errors in the build script.
</p>
<p>
    <b>MetaBuilder</b> doesn't just create trees of <tt>Node</tt>s, however.  In fact, it's very easy to tell <b>MetaBuilder</b> to construct
    a very specific graph of objects by specifying the classes to use in the schema.  For the next example, assume you have
    the following classes:
</p>
<pre>
    class Invoice {
        def date
        def items = []
    }

    class Item {
        def upc
        def qty
        def price
    } </pre>
<p>
    Here is what you would do to the previous schema to have <b>MetaBuilder</b> now construct an <tt>Invoice</tt> as
    above:
</p>
<pre>
        import groovytools.builder.*

        def mb = new MetaBuilder()
        def invoiceSchema =  mb.define {
            invoice <strong><em>(factory: Invoice)</em></strong> {
                properties {
                    date()
                }
                collections {
                    items {
                        item <strong><em>(factory: Item)</em></strong> {
                            properties {
                                upc()
                                price()
                                qty()
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } </pre>
<p>
    The previous builder doesn't even have to change!
